This homework assignment should be
submitted as a single PDF file both to D2L and to Gradescope.

General homework expectations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Homework should be typeset using LaTex.
    \item Answers should be in complete sentences and proofread.
    \item You will not plagiarize, nor will you share your written solutions
        with classmates.
    \item List collaborators at the start of each question using the
        \texttt{collab} command.
    \item Put your answers where the \texttt{todo} command currently is (and
        remove the \texttt{todo}, but not the word \texttt{Answer}).
\end{itemize}

Chapter 2, Problem 4. For each of the recursive definitions, give the recurrence
relation and state the recursion invariant. For Part (a), prove that your
recursion invariant holds.  For Part (b), prove that your recursion terminates
using a decrementing function.

\paragraph{Answer}{Part (a): Give the recurrence relation, state the recursion invariants, and prove that the recursion invariant holds.

\begin{equation}
lcs(A[1..m], B[1..n]) = 
\begin{cases}
    1 + lcs(A[2..m], B[2..n] & \text{if $A[1] = B[1]$}.\\
    max(lcs(A[1..m], B[2..n], lcs(A[2..m, B[1..n])), & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}}

The recursion invariant is: 

Proof: 

\paragraph{Answer}{Part (b): Give the recurrence relation, state the recursion invariants, and prove that the recurrence relation terminates using a decrementing function.}

The recurrence relation: 
\begin{equation}
SCS(A, B, m, n) = 
\begin{cases}
   $m + n$ & \text{$m = 0$}\\
   $m + n$ & \text{$n = 0$}\\
    SCS(A, B, m-1, n-1) + 1 & \text{A[m] = B[n]}\\
    min(SCS(A, B, m, n - 1), SCS(A, B, m - 1, n))+ 1 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The recursion invariant:
